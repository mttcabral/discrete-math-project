# Discrete Math Spiral Project

This is a university project for a Discrete Mathematics course (DCC216 @ UFMG). It provides C programs to calculate the (x,y) coordinates for the n-th point of three different 2D spirals:

* `espquadrada`: A square-based spiral
* `esptriangular`: A triangular-based spiral
* `minhaesp`: A custom-defined spiral

## Requirements

* A Linux environment
* `gcc` compiler
* `make`

## Build and Run Instructions

All commands are intended to be run from the root directory of the project in a Linux terminal.

### 1. Build
To compile all three spiral executables, use the Makefile:

```bash
make all
